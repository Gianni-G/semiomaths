# About

The philosophy and history of mathematics has recently evolved in the direction of understanding mathematical knowledge as a product of human practices rather than purely abstract logic. This has led to an increased importance of the analysis of mathematical language. However, the available tools for analyzing mathematical texts exhibit a lack of a systematic methodology associated with the absence of a solid connection between the perspectives of contemporary theories of language and the field of philosophy and history of mathematics. The SemioMaths project aims to fill this gap by introducing semiological insights and methods hitherto unexplored in the field, while establishing solid connections between the two domains. In particular, the project aims to propose a formal model for the automatic analysis of mathematical corpora, based on semiological theories and recent advances in formal and computational linguistics, that can provide relevant insights about the relation between mathematical knowledge and its historically determined textual expressions. Ultimately, this project seeks to improve our comprehension of mathematics as a human practice and its role in society, including theoretical and practical concerns in mathematics education, scientific communication, and the broader social and cultural contexts in which mathematical knowledge is produced and used. In this way, the SemioMaths project intends to contribute to increasing the connections between formal and natural sciences and the humanities.
