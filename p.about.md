# About

After graduating with a degree in political sciences (UNR, Argentina), I continued my studies in philosophy and mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure of Paris, as well as at the universities of Paris-​1 and Paris-​6. I defended a PhD with a dissertation on the mathematization of logic in the 19th century. At present, I am a Marie Skłodowska-​Curie Fellow at the ETH Chair of History and Philosophy of Mathematics. I am also an external researcher at the SPHERE laboratory of the Université de Paris. From 2012 to 2019, I was a senior lecturer in philosophy at the Fine Arts Academy of Montpellier (MO.CO.ESBA) and during 2012-​2013, I was a Fellow at the Akademie Schloss Solitude (Stuttgart).
